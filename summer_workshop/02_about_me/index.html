				<p>My name is Yoana and I am from Sofia, Bulgaria. Sofia is the capital and the biggest city in Bulgaria. My bachelors is in Accounting and before applying to the MSDV program I worked in clinical trials. I started teaching myself programming in 2019 and loved it. I made the decision to apply to the MSDV program as I have always found data analysis and collection the most interesting part of both economics and clinical trials.</p>

				<p>Although I do not have much time to play lately, I love playing chess. It is now only a hobby, but I used to play competitively for a long time. What I love about it is the many ways it develops one's thinking, personality and habits. You can learn some fun facts about chess <a href="https://www.gamesver.com/25-mind-blowing-facts-about-chess-with-pictures/">here</a>.</p>

				<p>Another hobby of mine is travelling. Since travelling within the European Union is relatively easy, I've been able to visit quite a few places in Europe. I find the Mediterranean countries to be fascinating with their rich history, beautiful nature and specific architecture. My favorite so far is Spain, particularly Barcelona, where Gaudi did most of his work. </p>

			<h2>Aspirations</h2>
			<div>
				<p>I've wanted to learn how to code since high school, but didn't have the time until very recently. While working in a clinical trials company as part of the data collection team, I realized how important it is to properly collect, analyze and represent data, so I started learning Python. Although Python and its libraries have amazing tools for data manipulation and visualization, I realized the need of deep understanding of the data analysis process and more sophisticated, interactive tools to visualize the results. My aspiration is to gather the skills and knowledge, that would enable me to represent data in a more human and digestable way, and do data visualization professionally.</p>
